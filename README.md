Hi!! Thank you so much for taking an interest in this code :). This was written in the Fall Semester of 2023 in a Computer Science 1 course, or CS 155. All comments that are in the code have been left as is
from the moment it was turned in. Overall, this C++ program is to take the user's input from the selection menu, and iterate the game. It should be noted, however, that the first option, "Play a Guessing Game,"
must have been selected and played at least once in order for the user to select and use the following three menu options to select from. If there are any questions regarding any specific parts of the source
file that the internal comments or project description does not clear up, or simply just any general inquiries or comments/suggestions, please let me know and reach out!!! :) My school email is jing@una.edu,
and my personal is jeslyning725@gmail.com.
